Without further ado, let’s jump into the fun part!

To give you an overview, you will be working on these tasks:

1. Create a backend with a set of RESTful API. (Node.js, Express, Sequelize with sqlite)
2. Create a frontend that consumes it. (React)
3. Push it to a public GIT repository.
4. Setup CICD.

Complete the respective tasks based on the role you are applying for. Before you start, please fork the repository.

## Task 1 - Create RESTful APIs

Using Node.js, express and sequelize (sqlite), accomplish the following HTTP contract. Clone this repository.

| Path     | Method | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /signup  | POST   | Takes in email and password. Returns a JWT Token for authorization                                                                                          |
| /process | POST   | Validate JWT token in the header. Process ./data/data.json file by inserting records into database using sequelize (ORM) where randAlphabet is 'a' and 'b'. |
| /fetch   | GET    | Fetch the persisted data and return them as HTTP Response Body.                                                                                             |

## Task 2 - Create React Frontend

Using React, create a signup screen and a home screen. The signup screen should consume _POST /signup endpoint_. The home screen should have a button that consumes endpoint _POST /process_ upon click.

_GET /fetch_ endpoint would return an array of objects that look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id":1,
        "randAlphabet":"a"
    },
    {
        "id":304,
        "randAlphabet":"b"
    },
    ...
]
```

For every object, render a square element with the value of property `randAlphabet` displayed in it using a grid layout.

## Task 3 - Push to a GIT Repository

Once you are done with the tasks, push them to a personal GIT repository (not the one you cloned from) and squash it. Share the repository with the interviewer.

---

## Task 4 - Create CICD Pipeline

Choose a CICD platform of your choice and create CICD pipeline with the GIT repository. Share the admin rights to the CICD platform with your interviewer.
